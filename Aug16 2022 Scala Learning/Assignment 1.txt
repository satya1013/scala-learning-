1.   What are the types of the following expressions?
•   1-   int
•   1.7  Double
•   1.0- Double
•   ’h’
•   "hi"- String
•   5/8- Int
•   1+0.5- Double
•   7*0.5- Double
•   "hi".length- Int


//4.Write a script that will calculate how far a projectile will go given a launch speed and an angle ignoring friction.
 Assume that the projectile is launched from ground level with a certain speed in m/s and at a certain angle in radians.
 Use the fact that acceleration due to gravity is 9.8m/s2

//sin(2θ)v2/g,
//(v = v0 − at)
import scala.math._
def dist(v: Double, a: Double): Double = {
 val g = 9.8
 val hs = v* cos(a)
 val vs = v*sin(a)
 //time taken for vertical distance to be 0
 //v = gt
 val t = vs/g 
 //horizontal distance = 2t * hors
 //var hord = hors*hors * sin(2*a)/g
 var hd = v*v*sin(2*a)/g
 hd
 }
print(dist(40, 0.87))

•     toUpperCase
•     trim
•     substring – This method takes two Int arguments.
•     replace – This method can be called with two Char arguments or two String arguments.


var str:String = " Satya"
str.toUpperCase
str.trim
str.substring(2,4)
str.replace(" ", "")

 Using Scala as a calculator, figure out how much you must make each year to bring home
  $100,000 assuming a 27% tax rate.


val inhand = 100000
//tax = 27
//total - 0.27 * total = inhand 
//0.73 * total = inhand
val total = inhand/0.73
print(total)


//7.
•   Assume you have a variable called age. Tell if the person is old enough to legally drink.


val age = 18
val status = if (age >= 18) "Can drink"
else "can not drink"
print(status)


•   Given a height in inches, tell if a person can ride an amusement park ride that requires riders
to be between 48” and 74”

val height = 36
val status = if (height >= 48 && height < 74 ) "Can ride"
else "Cannot ride"
print(status)

//8.
import io.StdIn._
val str = readLine()
val str1 = str.reverse
val result = if (str.compareTo(str1)==0){"The word is a palindrome"}
else "The word is not a palindrome"
print(result)
